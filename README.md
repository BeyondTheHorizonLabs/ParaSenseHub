# ParaSenseHub

ParaSenseHub is a service-level application that acts as a central hub for aggregating data from multiple sensors, devices, and probes. Designed as a companion to **EctoProbe**, it collects and streams data into a centralized log collection system, providing a seamless data pipeline for real-time monitoring and analysis.

---

## Features

- **Device Integration**:
  - Supports EMF detectors, magnetometers, GPS loggers, ground-penetrating radar, and more.
  - Aggregates data from multiple sources in real-time.
- **Data Streaming**:
  - Streams collected data to:
    - **S3 buckets**
    - **OpenSearch and Elasticsearch**
    - **PostgreSQL, MySQL, and other RDBMS systems**
    - **Redis for caching**
- **Scalable Design**:
  - Designed for deployment on distributed systems or as a standalone application.
  - Compatible with **SkinwalkerOS** and independent Linux-based systems.
- **Integration with EctoProbe**:
  - Provides the backend data pipeline for visualization and administration within EctoProbe.
  - Acts as a plugin for expanding device and sensor capabilities in the BeyondTheHorizonLabs ecosystem.
- **Log Management**:
  - Pre-configured support for log storage and analysis tools, including Graylog, Loki, and Prometheus.
  - Seamless integration with Grafana dashboards for real-time data visibility.

## Importance

ParaSenseHub is crucial for consolidating and managing the extensive data generated by multi-device configurations in applications such as:

- **Exotic Physics Research**:
  - Streamlining the collection of sensor data for phenomena analysis.
- **UAP Studies**:
  - Capturing and analyzing data from field deployments of detection devices.
- **Paranormal Investigations**:
  - Aggregating EMF, radar, and environmental readings to identify anomalies.

Its robust design ensures scalability, making it an essential component for organizations managing complex data streams.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later.
- Access to a central log collection system (S3, OpenSearch, RDBMS, etc.).
- Redis for caching (optional but recommended).
- Compatible sensors and probes for data collection.

## Installation

1. Clone the ParaSenseHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:BeyondTheHorizonLabs/ParaSenseHub.git
   cd ParaSenseHub
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the application by editing the `config.json` file:

   ```json
   {
     "logCollection": {
       "type": "opensearch",
       "host": "https://your-opensearch-instance",
       "port": 9200,
       "username": "admin",
       "password": "password"
     },
     "redis": {
       "host": "localhost",
       "port": 6379
     },
     "streaming": {
       "enabled": true,
       "s3": {
         "bucket": "your-s3-bucket",
         "region": "us-west-2"
       }
     },
     "devices": {
       "emf": true,
       "gps": true,
       "radar": false
     }
   }
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

### Integrating with EctoProbe

1. Ensure ParaSenseHub is running on the configured server.
2. Update the EctoProbe configuration to connect to ParaSenseHub:

   ```json
   {
     "parasensehub": {
       "url": "http://localhost:4000",
       "apiKey": "your-api-key"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart EctoProbe to begin receiving data streams from ParaSenseHub.

### Monitoring Logs

- Use OpenSearch Dashboards, Grafana, or Graylog for real-time log visualization.
- Connect ParaSenseHub directly to your preferred log management system for streamlined analysis.
